## Overview 🚀
Votingly is designed to enable secure and transparent voting directly within the Telegram messenger app using blockchain technology. This project leverages Biconomy’s AA infrastructure to provide seamless wallet integration and enhance user experience, making it easier for users to participate in decentralized polls.

## Features 🔒📊📈🔐
- **User Authentication and Wallet Integration:** Utilizes Biconomy’s AA Stack to seamlessly integrate crypto wallets within the Telegram Mini App, ensuring secure and convenient user authentication.
  
- **Poll Creation and Participation:** Enables users to create new polls and participate in existing ones directly from their Telegram interface. Each vote is recorded on the blockchain to ensure transparency and immutability of voting results.
  
- **Real-time Results:** Displays real-time voting results as votes are cast, enhancing transparency and encouraging user engagement throughout the voting process.
  
- **Security and Privacy:** Implements robust blockchain encryption methods to protect user identities and ensure the privacy of voting activities conducted through the app.

## Tech Stack 💻🛠️⛓️
- **Frontend:** Developed using React.js to deliver a modern and responsive user interface that seamlessly integrates with Telegram’s design principles.
  
- **Backend:** Powered by Node.js and Express.js to handle server-side operations and interactions with the blockchain infrastructure.
  
- **Blockchain Integration:** Integrates with the Ethereum blockchain (or another blockchain supported by Biconomy) to store poll data securely and maintain a transparent record of voting activities.

## Submission Requirements 🌐📝
- **Fully Functional Mini App:** Hosts the Decentralized Voting Mini App on a cloud provider of choice, ensuring it meets all submission guidelines provided by the MAHa Telegram Mini App Hackathon.
  
- **Documentation:** Includes comprehensive project documentation, such as project summaries, GitHub repository links, and any relevant technical details, to assist judges in evaluating the project’s innovation and functionality.

## Additional Considerations 🎨📈🏆
- **User Experience:** Focuses on delivering an intuitive and user-friendly voting experience tailored for the Telegram Mini App environment.
  
- **Scalability:** Designed with scalability in mind to accommodate potential increases in user activity during peak voting periods, ensuring a smooth and reliable voting experience for all users.

By integrating Biconomy’s AA infrastructure, the Decentralized Voting Mini App showcases the potential of decentralized applications (dApps) within Telegram, offering a practical solution for secure and transparent voting processes. This project aims to demonstrate innovation in blockchain technology and user engagement within the MAHa Telegram Mini App Hackathon.
